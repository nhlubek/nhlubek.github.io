## 

Hello and thank you for visiting my website.

 I’m a PhD student at Utrecht University Medical Center, where I’m studying epidemiology with a focus on socioeconomic differences in environmental health. My research uses large nationwide longitudinal data to address these important issues.

My background includes psychological research, social policy, and experience in EU policy advocacy. 
I work to find practical, data-driven solutions to complex social questions.
