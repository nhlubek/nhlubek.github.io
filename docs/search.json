    "text": "We show the importance of the association between social identity processes and reduced risk perception and highlight the relationship between transparent communication strategies and self-reported adherence to COVID-19 guidelines, identity leadership and trust in leaders to manage COVID-19 appropriately.\n\n\nAn exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation (maximum likelihood) was carried out using the psych package version 2.1.6 (Revelle, 2021) to ensure all items were clustering onto the appropriate factors. Descriptive statistics, including the correlations between the variables were obtained. The Lavaan package version 0.6-9 (Rosseel, 2021) was used to perform a mediation analysis using structural equation modelling (SEM), with 95% bias-corrected and accelerated (BCA) confidence intervals. Both models provided the regressions between each variable, the direct effects, the simple mediations via each mediator, and respectively the sequential mediation via both mediators in the second model.\nA bootstrapped Sobel test was conducted to assess the significance levels of significant mediation effects using the bmem package version 1.8 (Zhang & Wang, 2020) with 10,000 bootstrapped samples and 95% BCA confidence intervals. The variables were inputted in this test in the same order as the previous mediation models. An alpha level of  = .05 was used for all statistical tests."
