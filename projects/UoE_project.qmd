## Overview

This project, funded by the Scottish Government, aimed to understand the barriers healthcare workers (HCWs) faced in adhering to COVID-19 safety guidelines. The research explored how psychological group processes influenced perceived risk of COVID-19 and adherence to safety measures in hospital settings.

## Methodology

- **Exploratory Factor Analysis**: Conducted using the `psych` package in `R` to identify item clusters.
- **Mediation Analysis**: Performed using the `Lavaan` package in `R` to explore relationships between variables.
- **Bootstrapped Sobel Test**: Used to assess mediation effects with 10,000 samples for robustness.
